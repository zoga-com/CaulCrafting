I'm fixing and migrating this project for personal use, but if you want, you can use it too. The author has not accepted my pull-request for a year, so most likely, the development of a plugin for new versions will occur only in this repository.

Right now the plugin is fully tested and works on 1.19.*, I think it works on 1.12-1.18 as well, but I haven't checked that. I removed the NMS API binding from the plugin, so chances are that the plugin isn't as version-specific as it was before.
